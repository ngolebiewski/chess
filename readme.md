# Chess

I wanted to draw a pixel chess set, code the logic, and then embed this game within Washington Square Park in my Alley Cat 1999 game, so the player can 'earn money' by playing against chess hustlers in the Southwest corner of the park in 5 minute games. 

- ✅ 1: Draw a pixel chess set
- ✅ 2: Show the board and chess pieces in a start position
- ☑️ 3: Program in Logic
    - Allowed Moves
    - Special Moves
        - en passant
        - castling
    - Checkmate
    - Stalemate
    - Option for Draw
- ☑️ 4: Timer
- ☑️ 5: Move recorder (Use standard chess notation. Set which square with value i.e. b2)
- ☑️ 6: Code in a basic computer AI to play against, different characters with different agendas.
    - greedy greta --> always favors captures
    - cheating cheetah --> he always cheats and makes illegal moves. player has to call him out
    - grandmaster Bob (Fisher) --> balanced excellent play
    - normal Ned --> Easy AI
    - Funky Frida --> some of her pieces are tinted crazy colors, like a pink queen. Maybe an azul queen and draw her to look like Frida Kahlo.

- ☑️ 7: Chess hustler dialog boxes.
